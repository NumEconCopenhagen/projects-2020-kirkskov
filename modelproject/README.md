# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Solow Model and Green Solow Model** and is about exactly this. We implement both the models in Python by defining the necessary equations, doing the proper transformations and solving the transition equation. We do this analytically and numerically to find the steady state value of capital per effective worker under certain parameter values. Afterwards, we change the values and provide figures and interactive plot that help understand the effect of the parameters.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
