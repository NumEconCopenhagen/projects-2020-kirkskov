# Data analysis project

Our project is titled Income and Lifespan and is about the link between income and life expectancy on a municipal level in Denmark. Initially, we see that both variables have increases fairly consistently throughout the time period. A graphical analysis reveals that there are areas with a high concentration of wealth and high life expectancies, which indicated a positive correlation. Also, the specific municipalities with the highest and with the lowest levels of wealth are largely also the municipalities with the highest and lowest life expectancies. Finally, we plot the variables against eachother and find a clear positive correlation, as was expected. Wealthier municipalities have higher life expectancies on average.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
